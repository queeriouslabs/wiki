# Modding
This page describes the Modding process, which is how we modify how Queerious Labs operators. This process is used when there is community-wide impact and when it's hard to undo the change. If the effect of a change is relatively small, or isolated to a few people, or is very easy to undo, probably local consensus among the affected people suffices, and you should operate in Immediate Mode instead.

## The Process
1. After identifying a way that Queerious Labs could be improved, the improvement is brought to a meeting as a new mod. Mods should be goal's we'd like to achieve, ways that we can better achieve and embody our values as a space and a community, rather than particular changes to achieve those goals. For instance, "Queerious Labs' tools are operational and accessible." is a goal to achieve, but not a means to achieve that goal, and is thus a GOOD candidate for a mod. On the other hand, "Anyone who breaks a tool must repair the tool." is a means to achieve that goal, and is thus a BAD  candidate for a mod.
2. At the meeting, the participants brainstorm possible ways to achieve the goal. All the ideas people can imagine as relevant should be written down and put up on a board. This includes the default idea of "Do nothing."
3. Ideas are clustered into groups based on similarity: ideas which vary only by specific details (e.g. duration, places, etc.) should be considered equivalent and grouped together. Each cluster should represent a core idea of what *kind* of action to take, but not the parameters that such an action can have. For instance, "Open hours are from 7pm-12pm" and "Open hours are from 6pm to 11pm" are variations on the same core idea of "There are specified open hours", and so would get clustered together. On the other hand, "There are no specified open hours"  is fundamentally a different kind of thing to do, and so would be clustered separately. Clustering is done by consensus of those at the meeting, and the result of clustering is a single proposal for each cluster.
4. The mod and its proposals are then published on the wiki as a mod in the state "Rating". The mod is now in the "Rating" state, and progresses through the following steps:
		a. **Rating State**: Every member of the community has the opportunity to rate each proposals 1-5, or to block it entirely, during the first week of it being published on the mods page. Members can rate or block any number of proposals as they see fit. Blocks must come with explanations, and should only happen if the proposal is thought to be detrimental to the values of the community.
		b. **Ranking State**: During the first meeting after the mod was first published, the ratings for each proposal are averaged, and then sorted, with all blocked proposals sorted after all non-blocked proposals, and then sorted by average rating. The ratings and short should be reflected in the mod's entry on the wiki.
		c. **Implementation State 1**: The highest rated proposal, or a randomly chosen one if there are multiple equally highly rated proposals, is chosen as the proposal to try. The mod and it's top proposal is now in Implementation State 1.
		d. **Implementation State 2**: After one month at State 1, the mod is brought up for review. If no one wishes to add more proposals, the mod and its top proposal progresses to Implementation State 2. If anyone DOES wish to add more proposals, this is done, and we return to the step 3 of the modding process. If after ranking, the top-rated mod is still the same, then it also proceeds to State 2, otherwise the top proposal changes to the new one, and it enters State 1 as usual.
		e. **Implementation State 3**: After two months at State 2, the mod is brought up for review. If no one wishes to add more proposals, the mod and its top proposal progresses to Implementation State 3. If anyone DOES wish to add more proposals, this is done, and we return to the step 3 of the modding process. If after ranking, the top-rated mod is still the same, then it also proceeds to State 3, otherwise the top proposal changes to the new one, and it enters State 1 as usual. When a proposal reaches State 3, it is considered Implemented, and the modding process stops.
