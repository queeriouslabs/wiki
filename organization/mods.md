#### Details

The top rated proposal was to have tool-specific constraints on usage. To support this, we discussed some options for what
we can do. The ideas we settled on were as follows:

1. Have a README template that we can fill out and print and laminate and then mount on the constrained tools to point people to information about the tool and its constraints on usage.
2. Have a general info sheet we can give people explaining that some tools will have tool-specific constraints on usage, and that information about the tool will be posted on the tool.
2. Have a mailing list that makes it easy for people to get in touch with folx who are responsible for the tool-specific constraints.
