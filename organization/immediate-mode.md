# Immediate Mode
Immediate Mode is the way that small, relatively easily reverted changes are made to Queerious Labs. Immediate Mode works as follows:

1. Someone wants to make a change that will affect a handful of other people, but doesn't have a significant impact on everyone in the community or is easily reverted.
2. They check with the folx that will be affected, if feasible, and if no one objects, they make the change. If someone objects, they work to find an alternative that everyone can live with.
3. Whenever there is an impass, the Modding Process can be initiated, but this should be a last resort.

## Guidelines

There are some guidelines for operating in Immediate Mode which are useful to keep in mind.

1. The harder it is to revert a change, the more you should ask around to make sure folx are ok with it.
2. The larger the affect that the change will have, the more you should ask around to make sure folx are ok with it.
3. The larger the number of people that will be affected, the more you should ask around to make sure folx are ok with it.
4. Be kind, compassionate, and understanding.

This is especially true if the change is something that will be disruptive to others' use of the space, for instance, loud music, videos, use of loud tools, etc. You're not obligated to ask around but also you may be asked to stop or wait, because it's disruptive. This is a share space, so we should work to make it useful for everyone who's using it.
