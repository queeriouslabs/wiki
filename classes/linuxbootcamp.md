<!-- TITLE: Linux Bootcamp -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Solidify your Linux skills -->

Linux Bootcamp is a series of classes intended to help programmers solidy their Linux skills. Strictly speaking, it's not applicable only to Linux, but to most \*Nix systems, but Linux is the baseline given it's prevalence.

# Who This Class is For
This class is for everyone! But it's primarily aimed at programmers who use Linux command line tools to some degree, and who want to understand them better. This isn't an introduction to the internals of Linux, nor a class for people who want to switch to Linux from some other OS. Rather, it's for people who want to come to feel comfortable with Linux command line tools, and want to understand how to make use of them to work efficiently.
