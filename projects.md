# Software Projects
## Labrys: A toolkit for web autonomy
**_What is it?_** The aim of Labrys is to make it easy for people to have control of their online selves, by having easy to install software that can run identity servers, host websites, and manage access (both who can access your stuff and how you access others stuff), without corporate or government ability to shut you down, ban you, or otherwise influence your site, feed, identity, and so forth.
