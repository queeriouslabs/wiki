# About Queerious Labs

Queerious Labs is an experimental art and technology creative space and community workshop located in San Francisco's SoMa district. We're queers, women, feminists, people of color, trans folx — basically a collection of social outcasts — looking for new ways of organizing social situations in technically and artistically constructive contexts.
