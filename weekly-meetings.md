# Weekly Meetings
We have a weekly meeting at 7pm PST every Saturday at Queerious Labs. We try to have some collection of agenda items ahead of each meeting, but sometimes we don't and it's a little more ad-hoc. In any case, there are some recurring things that we go over each week that can be seen in our [meeting notes] template.
