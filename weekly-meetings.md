# Weekly Meetings
We at one point had a weekly meeting at 7pm PST every Saturday at Queerious Labs. We try to have some collection of agenda items ahead of each meeting, but usually we don't and it's a little more ad-hoc. In any case, there are some recurring things that people can go over each week that can be seen in our [meeting notes template](/weekly-meetings/meeting-notes/template).

We maintain a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14AH8dDq5rbtyB6iecWCXmmHNINgzXR5ajwlcndxsViU/edit?usp=sharing) of attendance to these meetings.
