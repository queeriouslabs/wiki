# Genmitsu 3018-PRO CNC Router DIY Kit

We have a fully assembled one of these, and it looks like it has upgraded steppers and a much beefier spindle.

The driver is the Woodpecker CanxTool

As of 3/20/2025, the board boots to GRBL 1.1f and accepts commands.  I was not able to get the steppers to move, and the spindle needs to be re-wired.

The powersupple is a a 24V 5A brick and the USB A - USB B mini cable ought to be cable-manged with it.

The power button on the driver board is just a white clicky thing and easy to miss.

Hopefully I will bring this up to a usable state.
