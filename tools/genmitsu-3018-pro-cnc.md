We have a fully assembled one of these, and it looks like it has upgraded steppers and a much beefier spindle.

The driver is the Woodpecker CanxTool

As of 3/21/2025, the board boots to GRBL 1.1f and accepts commands.  

Using the python program bCNC, I was able to home the device and move each stepper and the spindle.  Seems like it's in working condition.  Need to actually mill something and see what happens.

The power supply is a a 24V 5A brick and the USB A - USB B mini cable ought to be cable-manged with it.

The power button on the driver board is just a white clicky thing and easy to miss.

Hopefully I will bring this up to a usable state.
