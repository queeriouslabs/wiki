# Black Bin Tower (BBT)
The BBT resides downstairs, holding eight (8) black bins with yellow lids.  The bins may have QR codes on them, and associated wiki pages, which are aggregaged below.

The QR codes are the links, so there could easily be a difference between what the page says is in the bin, and what's actually in the bin.

If you find a difference, please make a change to the page.

The below table attemps to link to the bin in that position, but hey, who knows.

Apparently table syntax doesn't work in this version.  Oh well, deal with it.
