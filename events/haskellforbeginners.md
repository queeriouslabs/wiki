<!-- TITLE: Haskell for Beginners -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A class for newbies to learn Haskell! -->

# Description
Ever wanted to learn Haskell, but felt that the functional programming or Haskell communities were daunting? Too much snobbishness or elitism to feel welcome? Well good news! :)

This is a 4-week course on Haskell. We'll be using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) for our development environment, and Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell for our reference book.

We'll cover many of the topics in Hutton's book, and go through many of the exercises together in class.
