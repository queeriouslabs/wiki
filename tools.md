# 3D Printers
## Sparkmaker SLA Printer
Status: Seems to be fully functional, but prints wont stick to the print plate. A new FEP had no effect. It's unclear what the cause of this was. It might have simply been the orientation of the printed part, given it's surface area. The resin is also possibly a little older than is desirable.
