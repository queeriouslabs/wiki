# 3D Printers
## Sparkmaker SLA Printer
### Status as of 2019-08-23
Seems to be fully functional, but prints wont stick to the print plate. A new FEP had no effect. It's unclear what the cause of this was. It might have simply been the orientation of the printed part, given it's surface area. The resin is also possibly a little older than is desirable.

# Book Scanners
## Czur Book Scanner
### Status as of 2021-05-29
Fully functional.

### General Status as of 2021-05-29
